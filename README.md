# BERT Model

This code snippet demonstrates how to use TensorFlow Hub to access and utilize a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for text processing tasks. Here's an explanation of each part of the code:

**TensorFlow Hub URLs:** The code provides URLs to TensorFlow Hub for accessing BERT-related resources. The first URL links to a collection of available BERT models, while the second URL specifically points to a basic uncased BERT model with 12 hidden layers, a hidden size of 768, and 12 attention heads.

**Importing Libraries:** TensorFlow Hub and TensorFlow Text libraries are imported to facilitate the use of BERT models.

**Preprocessing with BERT:** The code loads the BERT preprocessing model and applies it to a list of text inputs. This preprocessing step tokenizes the text inputs and generates the required input tensors for the BERT model.

**Special Tokens:** BERT uses special tokens like [CLS] (for classification) at the beginning of each sentence and [SEP] (separator) to separate sentences or indicate the end of a single sentence.

**Loading BERT Model:** The code loads the BERT encoder model using the provided encoder URL.

**Encoding Text:** The preprocessed text inputs are passed through the loaded BERT model to obtain encoded representations. The output includes sequence outputs and pooled outputs, which capture contextual information from the input text.

**Encoder Outputs:** The BERT model produces encoder outputs, which include information from all encoder layers. Since the BERT base model used here has 12 encoder layers, the length of encoder outputs is 12.

**Sequence Output:** The sequence output is the output of the last encoder layer and contains contextualized representations of each token in the input text sequence.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to preprocess text data, encode it using a pre-trained BERT model, and access various outputs such as sequence representations and pooled representations for downstream tasks like text classification or sequence labeling.
